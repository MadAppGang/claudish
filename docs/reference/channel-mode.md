# Channel mode — developer reference

**Deferred from `CLAUDE.md` (v6.4.0+ section).** The wire-format constraint and the "why isn't it rendering?" checklist stay summarized in `CLAUDE.md`; this file holds the full contract. User-facing tool docs: `docs/usage/mcp-server.md` (§ Channel Mode).

The MCP server supports a channel mode that enables async model sessions with push notifications.

## Architecture

Uses the low-level `Server` class (not `McpServer`) from `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js` to declare `experimental: { 'claude/channel': {} }` capability. The SDK's `assertNotificationCapability()` has no default case — custom notification methods like `notifications/claude/channel` pass through.

### Components (`packages/cli/src/channel/`)

- **SessionManager** — spawns `claudish --model X --stdin --quiet` child processes, tracks lifecycle, enforces timeouts
- **SignalWatcher** — per-session state machine (starting→running→tool_executing→waiting_for_input→completed/failed/cancelled)
- **ScrollbackBuffer** — in-memory ring buffer (2000 lines) for session output

### MCP tools (11 total)

- **Low-level** (4): `run_prompt`, `list_models`, `search_models`, `compare_models`
- **Agentic** (2): `team`, `report_error`
- **Channel** (5): `create_session`, `send_input`, `get_output`, `cancel_session`, `list_sessions`

Tool gating via `CLAUDISH_MCP_TOOLS` env var: `all` (default), `low-level`, `agentic`, `channel`.

### Tool registration pattern

Uses a `ToolDefinition[]` registry with raw JSON Schema (not Zod). Two `setRequestHandler` calls replace McpServer's ergonomic API:
- `ListToolsRequestSchema` → returns filtered tool list
- `CallToolRequestSchema` → dispatches to handler by name

## Channel notifications

`server.notification({ method: "notifications/claude/channel", params: { content, meta } })` — pushed by SessionManager's `onStateChange` callback on state transitions. The method, capability, and params shape match Anthropic's [Channels reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/channels-reference) byte-for-byte.

The wire format is contractually pinned by `channel-wire-format.test.ts`:

```json
{
  "method": "notifications/claude/channel",
  "params": {
    "content": "<string>",
    "meta": {
      "session_id": "<8-char hex>",
      "event": "starting|running|tool_executing|waiting_for_input|completed|failed|cancelled",
      "model": "<model-id>",
      "elapsed_seconds": "<numeric string>",
      "task_id": "<same as session_id>",
      "status": "working|input_required|completed|failed|cancelled",
      "created_at": "<ISO 8601 from session start>",
      "last_updated_at": "<ISO 8601 at notification time>"
    }
  },
  "jsonrpc": "2.0"
}
```

When rendered by Claude Code, each notification arrives in the agent's context as:

```
<channel source="claudish" session_id="…" event="…" model="…" elapsed_seconds="…">
<content here>
</channel>
```

`meta` keys must match `[a-zA-Z0-9_]+` — Claude Code silently drops keys with hyphens or other characters. Our schema uses underscore-only keys (`session_id`, `elapsed_seconds`, etc.); when adding new `extraMeta` keys via `SignalWatcher`, keep this constraint.

The `task_id` / `status` / `created_at` / `last_updated_at` fields are SEP-1686 (MCP Tasks) forward-compatibility — additive only, no current consumer behavior change. The 7-value `event` collapses to the 5-value `status` per `EVENT_TO_TASK_STATUS` in `mcp-server.ts`. When Claude Code ships `notifications/tasks/status` receiver support, the migration is a method-name swap + payload restructure; see `ROADMAP.md` (Channel notifications → Phase 2) and `ai-docs/sessions/dev-research-mcp-tool-progress-20260508-235612-8d9da3e8/sep-1686-migration-schema.md` for the full plan.

## Enabling channel rendering in Claude Code

The Claudish MCP server emits the documented wire format, but Claude Code gates channel **registration** behind several conditions that have nothing to do with the wire contract. All of these must be satisfied for `<channel>` blocks to surface in the agent's context:

| Requirement | Why |
|---|---|
| Claude Code v2.1.80 or later | Channels feature minimum version |
| Anthropic auth via claude.ai OR Console API key | Channels are NOT supported on Bedrock, Vertex, or Foundry |
| Interactive session (no `-p` / `--print`) | Channel registration is bound to the interactive event loop. Empirically verified: in `-p` mode the registration codepath never runs and frames are silently dropped |
| Server defined in project `.mcp.json` or `~/.claude.json` | `--mcp-config` is NOT consulted by the channel resolver. Tools loaded via `--mcp-config` work; channels declared by the same server do not register |
| Server explicitly named in `--channels` OR `--dangerously-load-development-channels` | Being in MCP config alone is not enough. Per Anthropic docs: *"a server also has to be named in `--channels`"* |
| Org policy `channelsEnabled: true` (Team/Enterprise only) | Pro/Max users without an org skip this check |

**Launch command — bare server**:

```bash
# in a directory with .mcp.json containing a "claudish" entry
claude --dangerously-load-development-channels server:claudish
```

**Launch command — via the Magus `code-analysis` plugin** (Claudish is bundled there as an MCP server):

```bash
claude --dangerously-load-development-channels plugin:code-analysis@magus
```

The `--dangerously-load-development-channels` flag triggers a one-time confirmation prompt per session. To remove that prompt, the plugin would need to be added to Anthropic's curated channel allowlist (security review required) or to your org's `allowedChannelPlugins` managed setting.

## Diagnostic tracing — `CLAUDISH_CHANNEL_TRACE=1`

When the channel pipeline appears broken (e.g., client never renders `<channel>` blocks), set `CLAUDISH_CHANNEL_TRACE=1` before starting the MCP server. The diagnostics module (`packages/cli/src/channel/diagnostics.ts`) then emits `[channel-trace] …` lines to stderr at three checkpoints:

1. `fired sid=… type=… model=… elapsed=…s` — onStateChange callback entered (producer side fires)
2. `callback returned sid=… type=…` — bridge invoked `server.notification()` without throwing
3. `WIRE-OUT {…json…}` — the JSON-RPC frame literally hit stdout

If you see (1) but not (2): the bridge is throwing or rejecting silently.
If you see (1)+(2) but not (3): the SDK's transport is dropping the frame.
If you see all three but the client doesn't render the notification: the issue is client-side — most often one of the gating conditions above is unmet.

Off by default. Zero overhead in production.

When the MCP server is spawned by a host that captures stderr (e.g. Claude Code), set `CLAUDISH_CHANNEL_TRACE_FILE=/path/to/log` alongside `CLAUDISH_CHANNEL_TRACE=1` to mirror trace lines to a file you can `tail` from outside the host process. The file is opened with `appendFileSync` so multiple sessions append safely.

Three diagnostic scripts:
- `packages/cli/src/channel/test-helpers/channel-diagnostic.ts` — drives the MCP server with raw JSON-RPC against the OpenRouter free model. Confirms the producer→bridge→wire pipeline.
- `packages/cli/src/channel/test-helpers/client-diagnostic.ts` — spawns `claude -p` against the instrumented MCP server and compares what the server sent vs. what the client surfaced. Useful for diagnosing client-side gating.
- `packages/cli/src/channel/test-helpers/claudish-mock.ts` — a standalone mock MCP server that exposes a single `start_mock_session` tool, then emits a scripted sequence of 6 channel notifications over ~9 seconds. Decouples channel-rendering tests from real-model behavior.

## Testing

```bash
bun test --cwd . ./packages/cli/src/channel/*.test.ts
```

65 tests across 5 files: scrollback-buffer (11), signal-watcher (12), session-manager (21), e2e-channel (15), channel-wire-format (6). The wire-format tests run without an API key by using the fake-claudish PATH shim, so they execute on every CI run.

E2E tests use `--strict-mcp-config --bare --dangerously-skip-permissions` for isolation. SessionManager tests use a fake-claudish PATH shim (`channel/test-helpers/fake-claudish.ts`).
